<h2>My Past</h2>
<img class="left" src="images/iva_elementary.jpg" alt="Iva Elementary Schools">
<p>I was born on July 14,2000, in Anderson, SC. I lived in Anderson for most of my childhood. I began kindergarten at the age of 5 at <a href ="http://www.anderson3.k12.sc.us/Iva">Iva Elementary</a>. I attended the same elementary school all 5 years. I then went to Starr-Iva Middle School for 6th grade. That summer, my mom decided the best thing for us to do would be to move to Greenville, so she could be closer to her job. I then attended Beck Academy for my last 2 years of middle school. It was hard transferring to a new school and place, but I eventually adjusted and made many frieds. In 7th grade, I didn't talk to many people, but everyone was very nice and went out of their way to talk to me, specifically the students in my G&T english class. I made some of my first friends in that class, and we still remain friends today.</p>

<h2>Present</h2>

<img class="right" src="images/oitnb.jpg" alt="Orange is the New Black">
<p>I have 2 brothers and a pet bird. I currently enjoy to read and run. I spend a lot of my free time doing homework and watching Netlix. My favorite series is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Is_the_New_Black"> Orange is the New Black</a>, and Nurse Jackie runs a close second. My favorite subject in school is Calculus, but I also enjoy Anatomy and Physiology.</p>
<p>Most of my family currently lives in Anderson. My mom and I visit pretty much every weekend. On certain holidays, we have gatherings at my aunts house. My 2 brothers are out of college and on their own, so I'm the only one left in the nest.</p>

<h2>Future</h2>
<img class="center" src="images/winthrop_university.jpg" alt="Winthrop University">
<p>After high school, I would like to attend <a href="http://www.winthrop.edu/"> Winthrop University</a> and major in biology. I would then like to go to med school in Charleston and hopefully become a pediatrcian. If the job goal works out, I'd like to get married and have kids. I also want to own at least one dog, a <a href="http://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/siberian-husky#/slide/1"> husky</a> in particular.</p>
